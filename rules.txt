IF participants IS high OR available_slots IS low OR test_difficulty IS high THEN probability IS low

IF participants IS NOT high AND test_difficulty IS NOT high AND available_slots IS NOT low THEN probability IS medium

IF test_difficulty IS low OR (participants IS NOT high OR available_slots IS NOT low) THEN probability IS high
